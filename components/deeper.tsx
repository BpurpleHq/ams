              Certified Emotional Intelligence and Marriage Coach who has helped 100+ individuals
              and couples across the world transform how they think, feel, and show up in love, not
              by striving for perfection, but by learning how to grow together with awareness, empathy,
              and purpose.

            <p className="text-lg text-teal-900 leading-relaxed">
              I’ve been married for 11+ beautiful years, and every season has reinforced one lesson:
              <strong> “Your marriage is about you.”</strong> Through this bootcamp, you’ll get exposed
              to principles that empower you to show up with confidence and empathy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold text-teal-900">
              “Love alone isn’t enough to build a lasting marriage, but intentional growth is.”
